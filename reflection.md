Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    * I thought it was very helpful, practically speaking and I could totally see why people use it. 
    * I was also a bit afraid of how complex it seemed.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    * What worked and what didn't: I minimized my use of ChatGPT discussions and learned more from Stack Overflow discussions. It's incredible how I right now have the same question as someone from 12 years ago. 

    * My advice: Now that ChatGPT is real and widespread, use it at your own risk, but never at the cost of becoming a copy-paste machine. Also, start the assignments as early as possible to allow yourself time to struggle. 

    Struggle is normal and helpful !!!
